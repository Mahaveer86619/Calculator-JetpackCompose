**Jetpack Compose Calculator App**
This is a simple calculator app built with Jetpack Compose for Android. It allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Features**
1. Input field for entering expressions
2. Buttons for digits (0-9) and basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)
3. Displays the calculation result
4. Handles basic input validation

**How it Works**: The app uses Jetpack Compose for building the UI and logic. It consists of a text field for user input, buttons for numbers and operators, and a text view to display the result. When a button is pressed, the app updates the input field and evaluates the expression upon pressing the equal button. Basic input validation is included to prevent crashes due to invalid expressions.
